It's the end of your shift, and you see Remy sitting at one of the tables of your shop. #line:narrator-01
The rest of the customers are all gone. #line:narrator-02
After changing the store sign to closed, you grab some coffee and pastries for the two of you, and head to his table.#line:narrator-03
<<EnterRemy SceneManager>>
Remy: I know you've been working here all day, Marigold, so I appreciate you willing to meet me at your shop.#line:remy-01
Goldie: It's no problem! Honestly, I really love it here.#line:goldie-01
Goldie: I’m literally doing all the things I wanted to do in life. I get to run a florist-slash-bakery-slash-bookstore-slash-coffeeshop- slash bobacafe apothecary.#line:goldie-02
Remy: An Apothecary too?#line:remy-02
Goldie: That’s just for aesthetics. Nobody needs any medicine in the afterlife #line:goldie-03
<<RemySmile SceneManager>>
Remy: *chuckles* Kinda late for that, I suppose. #line:remy-03
Goldie: *laughs* Yeah!#line:goldie-04
And they live happily ever after. The End~

Remy: It’s… difficult work. Let’s just say I have to see a lot of people on their worst day.
Goldie: Are you a doctor?
<<RemySmirk SceneManager>>
Remy: *grin* Just for the aesthetics.
Goldie: *laugh* Right! Late for that! Sooo… *thoughtful* a cop?
<<RemyAngry SceneManager>>
Remy: No, nothing like that… I….. like to think of myself as a concierge. My job is to make people comfortable and help them kind of, move into a new phase of their life.
Goldie: A new phase of life?
Goldie: wha-....?
Goldie: Wait! I do know you! You’re a Reaper! You were MY Reaper! Holy Ghosts! How didn’t I see it before?
 <<set $GoldieKnows to true>>
 <<RemyPout SceneManager>>
Remy: *looks* panicked* Shh! Not so loud. Not many people like knowing there’s a… "Concierge" among them. It tends to make them uncomfortable.
Goldie: But you! You were there when I… 
Goldie: *bites back lip* Umm...
<<RemyPout SceneManager>>
Remy: *looks pained* You and many others...
Remy:I’m so sorry… if I’d known you were one of my clients I never would have... 
Remy: *He gets up to leave* I can… um… 
Remy: This was nice… but I should go.
-> Stop Him.
 <<jump DontGo>>
-> Do Nothing.
 Remy: You take care, Marigold…
 Goldie: *awkwardly* Yeah…you too Remy…
 Remy leaves.

Goldie: *grabs his arm* Wait! Don't go.
Date: *hesitates, saying nothing*
Goldie: *sincerely* Please.You haven’t even started on your pastry yet.
Date: *cautiously sitting back down* Are you sure?
Goldie: *smiles softly* I didn’t mean to freak you out, I just got excited when I realized why you looked so familiar.
<<RemySmirk SceneManager>> 
Remy: *looks unsure* Excited? You are… being too kind.
-> No really! I never got to thank you! <<if $test is false>>
<<RemySmile SceneManager>>
-> *smiles* I don't think I am..but lets not worry about it.
  Goldie: *smile* Look, that’s clearly a lot for a first meeting. We don’t have to talk about it right now. 
  Goldie:The reality is, I’m enjoying your company, and you being a “Concierge” is not a deal breaker by ANY means.
  Remy: Thank you, Marigold.
  Remy: I'm...enjoying you too.
  Goldie: You can call me Goldie.
  <<RemySmile SceneManager>>
  Remy: *smiles* Alright... Goldie.

  Goldie: I have a dog. His name's Bones
  <<jump PetDinner>>
  <<elseif $UpAtNight is false>>
  Goldie: So if you dont mine me asking, what DOES keep you up at night?
  Remy: My neighbor’s dog is always barking at my cat, Ms. Buttons whenever she goes out for her nightly vigil, staring at whatever moves, or nothing at all. 
  Remy: You know, Cat responsibilities.
  Goldie: *lights up with delight* That’s so cute! I didn’t know you had a cat! I have a dog. His name is Bones!

Goldie: So, how do you like the coffee?
<<RemySmirk SceneManager>>
Remy: It's actually really good. Espeically so, given I don't drink coffee.
Goldie: You don't like coffee?
Remy: It's not that I don't like it. It just keeps me up at nightm and I have a hard time sleeping at night as it is.
<<set $UpAtNight to true>>
-> How come? <<if $test is false>>

<<RemyPout SceneManager>>
Remy: *a bit startled* What?! 
-> I don't know, maybe you're on call like a doctor or something
<<RemySmirk SceneManager>>
 Remy: *grin* Just for the aesthetics.
 Goldie: *laugh* Right! Late for that!
-> Did I say something wrong?
<<RemyPout SceneManager>>
 Remy: *awkward* uh.. no... I just... I was surprised that you thought it was my job.
 Goldie: What DO you do for a job?
 Remy: I uhh...
 <<jump JobPath>>
Remy: No it's nothing like that. 
Remy: My neighbor’s dog is always barking at my cat, Ms. Buttons, whenever she goes out for her nightly vigil, staring at whatever moves, or nothing at all. 
Remy: You know, Cat responsibilities.
<<set $catVigil to true>>

<<RemySmile SceneManager>>
Remy: *playfully cynical* Does he bark at dutiful cats just trying to do their job of keeping the neighborhood safe from non-existent danger?
Goldie: *bright grin* Nah, he’s a sweet good boy. He barely barks, unless he’s whining for food.
Remy: *soft grin* Perfect. Looks like they have a lot in common already. Should get along great.
<<set $affinityMeter += 1>>
Goldie: I think so too!
<<RemySmile SceneManager>> 
Remy: *smirks* Maybe they should have a romantic dinner together sometime?
-> *eyebrow raise with a grin* They barely know each other yet! Bones needs a little more time to make that decision!
<<RemySmirk SceneManager>>
 Remy: *chuckles,  a little embarrassed* That’s… absolutely fair.
-> *smiles knowingly* Maybe they should.” 
 Remy: *grins*
 <<set $affinityMeter += 2>>
 <<set $confidenceMeter += 2>>
Goldie: Speaking of getting dinner together, what made you want to come to my shop for a first meet?
<<RemySmile SceneManager>>
Remy: Cuz it’s yours. Thought you might be comfy here. Plus I heard good things about it. Wanted to try your coffee, be a patron.
Goldie: This is your first time here?
Remy: Yeah, it is. I’ve heard of it. Never got around to trying it. But it’s a beautiful place. And the food and coffee are top tier. 
-> *bright grin* I’m glad to hear it! <<if $test is true>>
-> *accusing smirk* So technically you were only interested in my shop because you’re attracted to me?
<<RemySmile SceneManager>>
 Remy: *cool flirt*  I prefer to think of it as “My attraction to you drew me to a place that I might have never known the pleasure of. 
 -> *eye roll with a chuckle* You don’t get off that easy!
 -> *tries to force down a pleased grin* That does paint you a better light..
  Remy: *a mildly smug smile* But do you like it? Me… in this better light, I mean?
META: Well? Does she? Only Time will Tell!
->Jump to Beginning
